//! The captions sheet: the tray's Captions tool, as a form and then as a
//! progress report.
//!
//! One switch says what it captions: "Use Sample Voice", on, takes
//! the words from a clip with sound, chosen in the sheet from the clips on
//! the timeline that have any; off, from a script typed in it. It opens on
//! when a clip with sound is selected, or when a clip's menu opened it on
//! that clip, and off otherwise. Either lands as one batch of title clips,
//! one undo step.
//! The transcriber runs on a worker and reports as
//! [`CaptionsMsg::Progress`], ending as [`CaptionsMsg::Finished`].
//!
//! The sheet also reads a SubRip file in as captions, with the same look,
//! and writes the timeline's captions out as one.
