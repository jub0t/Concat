    // binary that is the whole application: six font faces, a logo and twenty
    // effect previews travel inside it, so there is no directory to ship
    // beside it and no path to get wrong.

    // Not `EmbedForSoftwareRenderer`, which pre-decodes to raw pixels: that is
    // for MCUs with no filesystem, it is the only kind the software renderer
    // can read, and Skia and FemtoVG cannot use it at all.
